# chatbot_vertexsearch_langchain
The goal is to propose a chatbot architecture approach that leverages Vertex Search and LLMs wrapped by LangChain for a really custom retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Dialogflow CX serves as the interface and conversation control, giving the opportunity to bring OOTB features for curation and transactional operations (but it is optional!).
